<p>In the last couple months, I&rsquo;ve had a bit of an eye-opening about Geography. People actually trained in geography may implicitly understand this but I, with my Accounting degree, have spent the last 16 years &lsquo;doing&rsquo; GIS without realizing the foundation of geography–geology. I picked up enough geography to understand some of the inter-relationships between people and the lands they live on.</p>
<p>But what I didn&rsquo;t pick up on was how the lands we live on are formed. Maybe it is a moot point–how physical geography is arrived at doesn&rsquo;t matter, just how we react to it. But, and now working for a Geological Survey, I better have this opinion, a better understanding of what our geology is and how it was formed really does form the foundation for the geography.</p>
<p>Two examples. First, in talking with my new supervisor, he was talking about how, because of the geology in the southeast part of the state, they have a lot of water quality issues–the water tends to have sulfur in it. With the recent interest in alternative energy sources, and in this case ethanol plants water quality is a concern when deciding where to build the plants because they require a considerable amount of water. For some reason there have been plants placed in this part of the state and they are having some problems finding sufficient water.</p>
<p>The second, and I&rsquo;m not sure that this is actually fact or just a theory but it is an interesting idea, was something I read in Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s book <em>Outliers</em>. In the book, it was suggested that there was an almost epidemic of feuds, a la Hatfield-McCoy, in part of the US largely due to the geology of a portion of the country. The areas that relied on a herding economy developed a clannish &lsquo;code of honor&rsquo; that led to these long-term feuds. While I understood that physical geography effects human behavior I hadn&rsquo;t taken the mental step to link geology to physical geography.</p>
<p>Pretty silly and probably obvious oversight.</p>
<p>And to think, I use to think the &lsquo;G&rsquo; in GIS should really stand for Geometry. Humph!</p>
