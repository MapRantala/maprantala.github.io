      <title>ArcGIS Pro 2.0 Migration Overview</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April I started a new position at a company that had no existing GIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a definite need for GIS and some GIS-type functions were occuring but basically when I started, I had an &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;ArcGIS Enterprise&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; license and a mess of KML files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exciting opportunity. And since I was starting from scratch, I had zero legacy concerns. No existing data, workflows, custom code, or maps to tie me to a specific software package. Knowing that ArcGIS Pro is taking over the world, I decided to transition to ArcPro and use that as our (GIS staff count of 1) company standard for desktop mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That plan got side-tracked somewhat when we purchased a data management tool (&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;CrescentLink Network Manager&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;) that is only available for ArcMap. But I have still been using Pro on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a brilliant post about the transition–the pros, the cons, and my overall experience. But before I could finish it, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;out came 2.0&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; and my post was suddenly out-dated. So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to split that post into a bunch of smaller, more focused posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without getting into to deep on specific features or functionality, I do have some broad comments to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;learning-curve&#34;&gt;Learning Curve&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is definitely a learning curve in moving from ArcGIS Desktop to ArcGIS Pro–even though there is a lot of the same concepts between Pro &amp;amp; Desktop (the Toolboxes have barely changed), just finding the tools was a huge hurdle at first. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a fan of the ribbon interface, I like my tools to be where they are and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with regular use, I have gotten more adept at finding what I want to use. Still end up hunting for tools at times but it has gotten better. I&amp;rsquo;m probably at about 75% efficiency as compared to Desktop although I switch between the two on a regular basis because there are times where I just need to get something done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;stability&#34;&gt;Stability&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I just had to force-stop a session, 2.0 has made significant strides in stability. I had near daily crashes with 1.5 but now it is maybe a once-a-week. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve learned what not to do in Pro but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember any pattern to the crashes I had with 1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;performance&#34;&gt;Performance&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance is still painful to me. There are too many times when the wait cursor shows up when you do simple things like clicking on a button. A lot of the processing has been routed through the geoprocessing system and it just seems much slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;version-20-highlights&#34;&gt;Version 2.0 Highlights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do some whining about ArcGIS Pro in this planned series of posts, there were a couple of significant highlights to the 2.0 release that took care of two of my major usability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown accustom to ArcPro. Like any new software, it takes time to get a feel for it. The transition is not that much different from going from ArcView 3.x to ArcGIS Desktop (or whatever 8.x was called). I am not yet as productive in it as Desktop but there are some things I really like about it to go along with my complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
