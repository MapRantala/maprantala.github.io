      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent almost nine years working for a great company, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adc4gis.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Applied Data Consultants!&lt;/a&gt;, through a variety of rolesâ€“spent approximately 3 weeks doing Parcel work as a GIS Tech before I started working in Avenue for my own sanity. After that, spent several years doing various programming tasks including building tools for internal production and application development. The last couple years, I served more of a Consultant role, both for internal and external clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where one polyline ends, another starts in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a couple days, I start my role as Geological Information Specialist at a state agency in Minnesota. I previously worked for the Wisconsin DNR (where I originally &amp;lsquo;discovered&amp;rsquo; GIS) and Pierce County, Wisconsin so I have some governmental experience but I am wondering how I will adapt to the organizational differences.&lt;/p&gt;
