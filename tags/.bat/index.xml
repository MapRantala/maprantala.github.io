      <title>Accessing Network Drives via Scheduled Python Task</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, I have a scheduled nightly backup that is written in Python.  Most of it has been working fine but I had not gotten it to copy files to network drives.  I finally got around to correcting that part.  My first attempt was just to map the network drives for the user account that is used to run the task.  No good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second attempt was to call a .bat file from python before accessing the network drives and that worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The batch file has two lines (one for each network drive):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;net use n: \domain1sharename mypassword /USER:domainusername&lt;br&gt;
net use t: \domain2sharename mypassword /USER:domainusername&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my python script includes two lines to call it before I access the network locations:&lt;/p&gt;
