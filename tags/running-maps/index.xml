      <title>Friday Fave: Tapiriik</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://maprantala.com/category/fun-maps/friday-fave/&#34;&gt;Friday Fave&lt;/a&gt; is a little bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interest in geospatial technologies (although we just called it GIS back then) largely because I wanted to measure my running routes more accurately and efficiently than the paper map &amp;amp; scrap of paper method I was using in the early 90s. When I was introduced to GIS, I knew what I was going to use it for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that GPS technology is ubiquitous–I&amp;rsquo;m currently using four different GPS devices, at the same time, on my bike rides–I seldom have to use a map to measure my routes. I may still use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mapmyrun.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MapMyRun.com&lt;/a&gt; to plan a route ahead of time if I&amp;rsquo;m running in a new area or trying to plan a loop of a certain distance but GPS has really made it so simple to just go out and run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are several GPS options available, I have used Garmin ever since their 405 Forerunner came out. This was their first watch that didn&amp;rsquo;t get confused for a Timex-Sinclair 1000 strapped to your wrist.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_928&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-928&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://maprantala.com/images/2014/04/Zx81-timex-manipulated2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Timex Sinclair 1000&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-928&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Timex Sinclair 1000&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garmin&amp;rsquo;s watches upload their data to &lt;a href=&#34;https://tapiriik.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gamin Connect,&lt;/a&gt; which works fine, but for a project I recently started, I wanted to down load all my data which Garmin Connect does not make easy. I had over 1,000 data logs and downloading them individually was not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little Googling led me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://tapiriik.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tapiriik.com&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to share data amongst several different online services that endurance athletes might use including Runkeeper, Strava, Garmin Connect, SportTracks, DropBox.com, and Training Peaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://maprantala.com/images/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-24-at-9.52.48-PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;https://tapiriik.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use Tapiriik for free (you just need to visit their website to start synchronization) or for $2 per year they will automatically synchronize data between your accounts. You just provide your account information for whichever sites you want to synchronize and either visit their site or pay $2 and it will automatically share data between your accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I linked to my Garmin Connect and Dropbox accounts and tapiriik and after some chugging, I had .GPX files for all of my data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was easy and didn&amp;rsquo;t take very long. Definitely met my needs–I haven&amp;rsquo;t shared data between other services but I do use the desktop version of SportTracks and considered using their web version of the software but didn&amp;rsquo;t know how I would upload all my data.  Now I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This product definitely saved me a bunch of time. The one thing I wonder, though, is what does &amp;lsquo;Tapiriik&amp;rsquo; means?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Friday Fave: Public Workout Maps</title>
      <link>https://maprantala.com/2014/04/05/friday-fave-public-workout-maps/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2014 05:15:31 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first found out about GIS, the first application that came to mind was using it to map my running routes. At that time, I was using paper maps and scraps of paper to measure how far I was running each day. GIS obviously offered a better method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost twenty years later, GPS has become so common place that I think we have four or five devices in our household that have GPS capabilities and measuring my runs has become ridiculously simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that background, you can understand why I love projects like &lt;a href=&#34;http://barsukov.net/endomondo.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this project&lt;/a&gt; by Nikita Barsukov, who compiled publicly available data from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.endomondo.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Endomondo&lt;/a&gt; and created maps of public running workout tracks for a variety of European Cities, including this sample from Helsinki.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_874&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-874&#34; style=&#34;width: 300px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://maprantala.com/images/2014/04/helsinki.png&#34; alt=&#34;helsinki&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-874&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://barsukov.net/endomondo.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Barsukov.Net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Flowing Data, using a similar concept, generated &lt;a href=&#34;http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;similar maps&lt;/a&gt; for several cities in the United States, including &lt;a href=&#34;http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/#jp-carousel-33732&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;–some areas I know.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_877&#34; aria-describedby=&#34;caption-attachment-877&#34; style=&#34;width: 214px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/#jp-carousel-33732&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-877 &#34; alt=&#34;http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/#jp-carousel-33732&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/maprantala.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-03-at-7.57.30-PM-214x300.png?resize=214%2C300&#34; width=&#34;214&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id=&#34;caption-attachment-877&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/&#34;&gt;http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got about six years of running data of my own that I should use to generate a personal running route map but would be a fun project.&lt;/p&gt;
