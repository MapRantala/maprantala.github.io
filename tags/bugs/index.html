</header>
<div class="content">
Because we use ArcGIS Online Web Maps in our daily work-flows, I created an AGO group that contains Feature Layers that are links to our self-hosted ArcGIS Server services. This way, users can quickly add data from our ArcGIS Server Site and not have to look up URLs/Usernames/Passwords (I’ve save the username/password as part of the ArcGIS Online service when appropriate).
But I’ve had a problem where if I change the service, the changes are not reflected in the AGO Feature Layer for that service and I have to monkey about to get the changes to migrate to the maps.

<div class="content">
A while ago I posted a work-around for a problem I was having with a Web AppBuilderapplication. Working with Esri tech support, we determined what I was doing to cause the problem.
In my config.json, I was using a relative path to the proxy. Note that I had the proxy as a separate application at the root level of our domain because I intended to have a shared proxy for all of our applications instead of individual ones.

<div class="content">
I recently downloaded Web AppBuilder 2.4, Developer’s Edition and built a quick &amp; dirty app. For some reason, it worked fine in Web AppBuilder but once I deployed it, no basemaps would show in the Baseman Gallery widget, it would just spin, spin, spin.

Digging around, I found some old posts where users were experiencing similar problems but none of the solution resulted in a great solution. I was able to get it to work by listing the basemaps individually in the config_BasemapGallery.

Random luck me to discovering a bug related to feature classes whose names start with “nd_”. It appears that you are allowed to create feature classes starting with “nd_” but ArcCatalog will not display them. Further research shows this behavior also occurs for table and for ArcSDE (PostGres) geodatabases, personal geodatabase, and file geodatabases–I am using ArcCatalog 10.0.
I first noticed something odd was occurring while importing a series of shapefiles into a geodatabases.

I was working my way through this ESRI Walkthrough: Building custom UI elements using add-ins (ArcObjects .NET 10 SDK). And came across a couple minor errors that I had to correct during the process.
First, while implementing the OnClick() code for ZoomToLayer.vb, Visual Studio gave me a “Name ‘ArcMap’ is not declared.” error.

In the walk-through, they mention that the ArcMap method of your class. For me, however, it appeared under the .

We finally installed an instance of ArcSDE 10 today. My first attempt at connecting in ArcCatalog 9.3.1 failed with the following error:
 Failed to connect to the specified server.
This release of the GeoDatabase is either invalid or out of date. [Please run the
ArcSDE setup utility using the -o install option.]

 Turns out the solution was simple, this article points out that Service pack 2 is required.

<div class="content">
I have been working on updating some data that was published using Arc/Info Workstation Export (.e00) files, converting them to shapefiles, or in the case of annotation, to a geodatabase feature class.
While converting some INFO tables, I have received this error:Unable to encode the 38th item in the 65th record for the INFO fileIt turns out that Workstation can create export files that contain values that did not fit within their field–I’m guessing that somehow you are actually able to enter invalid values into those fields but I did not confirm that.

<div class="content">
Came across a new ArcMap bug today. A staff member was trying to join an Excel 2007 file (.xlsx) to a point shapefile in ArcMap and it did not appear to be working. She only had Office 2003 on her machine so I tried it on my spanking new machine that has 2007 installed. Same result–the fields get appended but they are all blank.
I discovered, however, that when I had the table open, if I switched form showing ALL records to only the selected, Poof!
