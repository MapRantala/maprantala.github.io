Because we use ArcGIS Online Web Maps in our daily work-flows, I created an AGO group that contains Feature Layers that are links to our self-hosted ArcGIS Server services. This way, users can quickly add data from our ArcGIS Server Site and not have to look up URLs/Usernames/Passwords (I&rsquo;ve save the username/password as part of the ArcGIS Online service when appropriate).
But I&rsquo;ve had a problem where if I change the service, the changes are not reflected in the AGO Feature Layer for that service and I have to monkey about to get the changes to migrate to the maps.

I recently downloaded Web AppBuilder 2.4, Developer&rsquo;s Edition and built a quick &amp; dirty app. For some reason, it worked fine in Web AppBuilder but once I deployed it, no basemaps would show in the Basemap Gallery widget, it would just spin, spin, spin.
Digging around, I found some old posts where users were experiencing similar problems but none of the solution resulted in a great solution. I was able to get it to work by listing the basemaps individually in the config_BasemapGallery.

I was recently re-evaluating our back-up procedures and discovered and found a nasty bug with the arcpy&rsquo;s ListFeatureClassesrequest. If you have a feature class in a feature dataset with the same name, ListFeatureClasses may not find it or anything else in that feature dataset.
Unfortunately, we recently made our daily backup a python-based system that uses ListFeatureClasses and got bit by this bug.
After discovering missing data in our backups, I reconstructed what happened and found this bug.

Awhile ago, I had a ArcSDE problem that required ESRI technical support to help trouble-shoot. The problem was odd but was resolved by rebooting the server.
During the process, though, the support person had me set a couple of environment variables for logging SDE activity on the client machine.
The settings were SDEINTERCEPT and SDEINTERCEPTLOC.
From ESRI&rsquo;s Help, SDEINTERCEPT specifies what activity to log and SDEINTERCEPTLOC specifies where to save the log files.

Seems like a lot of people are finding the ArcMap Field Calculator examples that I have posted useful so I will make an effort to post more of them. Most posts are generated after I do something and think that others might want to know how to do it. (Or so I can go back and remember how I did something without re-inventing it).

You may have noticed that this post–ArcMap Field Calculator: Identifying Unique Cases, Single Field–specifies &lsquo;Single Field&rsquo;. Yes, that was my version of a cliff-hanger post.
The basic structure I listed in that post can be expanded on to satisfy your needs. The example in my earlier post was case sensitive for example, you could modify it so it treats &lsquo;a&rsquo; the same as &lsquo;A&rsquo;.
Today&rsquo;s example groups records into different cases based off the values of two fields, !

Almost a year ago, I updated ERSI&rsquo;s Domain Sort code for VB 6 to work with ArcGIS 10. Recently, I had a comment that this Add-In caused ArcCatalog to explode if you had an open OLE connection. When I tested it, it turned out the reports were accurate.
I got around to adding in a Try-Catch around the offending chunk of code &amp; it is now better than ever. You can download just the Add-In or the Add-In with source code or get it from ESRI&rsquo;s ArcGIS Resource Center.

As contributor of the day, Jason Scheirer, pointed out, python has a simple, direct way to browse through the subdirectories of a directory–os.walk
Here is a bare-bones example of using it to print out the subdirectories in a path. The files variable of the 3-tuple is a list of files similar to the dirs variable that I loop through.
Thanks Jason for pointing out something I missed.
import os theDir = &#39;c:/temp/&#39; for root, dirs, files in os.

Testing one of our geodata services, we discovered that it allowed us to extract a portion of our feature class but when we tried to extract the entire data set, we received this Data Extraction error: Data extraction failed. Proxy or Gateway Server did not allow the URL. Check with your LAN administrator that Proxy or Gateway server is configured to allow the URL.
The fact that I was able to extract a portion of the data and I could see the entire geodatabase get made and zipped led me to believe it was more of time-out issue.
