<p>This <a href="https://maprantala.com/category/fun-maps/friday-fave/">Friday Fave</a> is a little bit different.</p>
<p>My interest in geospatial technologies (although we just called it GIS back then) largely because I wanted to measure my running routes more accurately and efficiently than the paper map &amp; scrap of paper method I was using in the early 90s. When I was introduced to GIS, I knew what I was going to use it for.</p>
<p>Now that GPS technology is ubiquitous–I&rsquo;m currently using four different GPS devices, at the same time, on my bike rides–I seldom have to use a map to measure my routes. I may still use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MapMyRun.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to plan a route ahead of time if I&rsquo;m running in a new area or trying to plan a loop of a certain distance but GPS has really made it so simple to just go out and run.</p>
<p>While there are several GPS options available, I have used Garmin ever since their 405 Forerunner came out. This was their first watch that didn&rsquo;t get confused for a Timex-Sinclair 1000 strapped to your wrist.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/maprantala.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Zx81-timex-manipulated2.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Timex Sinclair 1000<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Garmin&rsquo;s watches upload their data to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gamin Connect,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which works fine, but for a project I recently started, I wanted to down load all my data which Garmin Connect does not make easy. I had over 1,000 data logs and downloading them individually was not going to happen.</p>
<p>A little Googling led me to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tapiriik.com<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which allows you to share data amongst several different online services that endurance athletes might use including Runkeeper, Strava, Garmin Connect, SportTracks, DropBox.com, and Training Peaks.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/maprantala.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-24-at-9.52.48-PM.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can use Tapiriik for free (you just need to visit their website to start synchronization) or for $2 per year they will automatically synchronize data between your accounts. You just provide your account information for whichever sites you want to synchronize and either visit their site or pay $2 and it will automatically share data between your accounts.</p>
<p>I linked to my Garmin Connect and Dropbox accounts and tapiriik and after some chugging, I had .GPX files for all of my data.</p>
<p>It was easy and didn&rsquo;t take very long. Definitely met my needs–I haven&rsquo;t shared data between other services but I do use the desktop version of SportTracks and considered using their web version of the software but didn&rsquo;t know how I would upload all my data.  Now I know.</p>
<p>This product definitely saved me a bunch of time. The one thing I wonder, though, is what does &lsquo;Tapiriik&rsquo; means?</p>
