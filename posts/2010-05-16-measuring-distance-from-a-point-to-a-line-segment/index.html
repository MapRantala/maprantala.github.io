<p>I recently had the need to calculate the distance from a point (address point) to a polyline (street segment) and wanted to avoid using any additional libraries because it was being done for an external client. Ok, I actually used arcgisscripting for reading the data but that lacked, from what I could tell, the fine-detail granularity of measuring distance between individual geometries.</p>
<p>But since the only spatial operations I needed were to measure the distance between two points and the distance between a point and polyline, I decided to just do it via brute force. The datasets being processed were not huge so it made this feasible.</p>
<p>Measuring point-to-point distance was easy enough. And while I knew I could work through the details of measuring the distance between a point and polyline, I decided NOT to re-invent the wheel if I did not have to. Google did not come up with any direct answers but I did come across this <a href="http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/%7Epbourke/geometry/pointline/">post</a> from <a href="http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/%7Epbourke/" title="Paul Bourke">Paul Bourke</a> at the <a href="http://wasp.uwa.edu.au/">University of Western Australia</a> about measuring the distance between a point and a line segment. A polyline is just a series of line segments so I used it as the basis of my measurement–I just loop through all the consecutive vertice pairs, using the minimum distance found.</p>
<p>Paul did not have a python implementation included, so I went ahead and created my own from his information.</p>
