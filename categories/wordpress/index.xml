      <title>WordPress Permalinks Snafu</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using a free &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;StatCounter.com&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; add-in, I get weekly emails showing the number of visitors to this blog. During the summer, the numbers plummeted. At the time, I thought it had to do with Google/Chrome requiring https.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, HostGator (disclosure: I’m working on becoming a HostGator affiliate), who I use to host this blog and a few other websites, provided free https certificates for all of my sites. So I made sure that &lt;a href=&#34;https://MapRantala.com&#34;&gt;https://MapRantala.com&lt;/a&gt; worked and thought the numbers would rebound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the chart, you can see they did only slightly. I assumed that it would just be a matter of time for Google to see that https was enabled and since the blog is more a place for me to make notes to myself, I wasn’t concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend, I decided to take a look at Google’s Search Console and see if I could determine what was going on. Looking in the coverage, I saw many 404 results for pages. As I investigated some of them, I realized that it was due to my Permalinks setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URLs, as shown below, were not working.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website was using “https://maprantala.com/index.php/” as the base URL. So, for example, “https://maprantala.com/2017/08/07/arcgis-pro-2-0-migration-overview” did not work but “https://maprantala.com/&lt;strong&gt;index.php&lt;/strong&gt;/2017/08/07/arcgis-pro-2-0-migration-overview” did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the WordPress Permalinks setting, I went to Settings-Permalinks and removed he “index.php/” from the Custom Structure. Waiting a day, the 404s have disappeared in Search Console and, in theory, I just need to wait for Google to re-index the pages which are currently shown as “Crawled – currently not indexed”&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;WordPress Permalinks Setting &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may not have been the whole problem. I republished this blog under a different name for a year. But moved it back to this domain when that domain registration expired. So that may have been another factor.&lt;/p&gt;
