</header>
<div class="content">
Working with a routine process today that I normally only do once in awhile but today needed to do it several times. It requires changing the definition query on several features classes. Being the “lazy” GIS guy that I am (owner of a company I used to work at called me that once as a sort of compliment for my tendency to script a lot of what I did), I decided to finally script it instead of changing definition queries about 42 times.

<div class="content">
Working on doing some advanced ArcGIS server printingand had the need to batch convert many existing .mxd files to .lyr files. So instead of opening up X number of map documents, thought I would do it via code. All of my .mxds in this case had just one data frame so the process was pretty simple–I add an empty group layer (Thanks Petr Krebsfor the idea), copy all the existing layers into it, and save it out as a layer file.

<div class="content">
Recently I’ve created Python add-insfor data entry for our staff. Most of these have a toolbar with a “Help” button that opens a help file in .pdf format.Sample python add-in toolbar.The first add-in was for ArcCatalog and this worked splendidly. I was using os.startfile(path to help.pdf).
However, when I started doing ArcMap add-ins, clicking the Help button would open the help.pdf but ArcMap would crash. Oops!
Luckily the Python development team at Esrialready had a blog postabout this at their ArcPy Café blog.

</header>
<div class="content">
I’ve been working on a few different data import routines and one of the things I recently built was the ability to verify that a potential Code to be entered into a field with a Coded Value Domainis valid.
The logic of the code is pretty straight-forward. Get a field’s domain and check that a potential value is one of the code values. The biggest “trick” in this code is that arcpy.

<div class="content">
I just had the need to go through a directory containing many (100+) layer files (.lyr) and verify the data sources in each. I could have loaded each into ArcMap and checked the properties, but choose not to. Here’s the bare-bones script I used instead:

<div class="content">
I’m in the process of rewriting a process, moving most of the processing from arcpy to postgresql-enabled python (love me some psycopg2).
One of the QC checks I’m doing at the end of this re-write is just verifying that the feature class schemas are the same (or that the differences are intended) under the new process as they were in the old process.
And while ArcGIS does have a good toolfor this, there were a couple tweaks I wanted to make.

I mentioned using Tapiriikto batch download my entire Garmin Connect history–over 1,000 separate .GPX files. I found several tools to convert .GPX to shapefilesthat worked but none seemed to recognize my heart rate data.
The trick is Garmin extends the GPX specification to incorporate the heart rate:
Each track point looks like this:
 Since the first few exiting GPX converters failed to meet my needs, I decided to make my own, at least partially.

<div class="content">
Back in 2010, I posted a python script and an ArcToolboxtool for zipping a shapefile.
Well, I had a request to modify the code so it would not error out if it encounters a .lock file. While .lock files exist for a reason and shouldn’t be totally ignored, in some cases it is safe to do so, so I went ahead any modified the code, which can be downloaded from Github.

</header>
<div class="content">
In mapping cross sections, our geologists often find themselves renaming their stratigraphic units midway, or at the end, of creating multiple cross sections. This can cause a situation where we need to change multiple values in multiple fields in multiple feature classes–a situation that can get messy very fast.
Perfect situation for a quick &amp; dirty arcpy script and, in this case, an ArcToolbox tool that can be downloaded.
This tool will change all feature classes in the O:\clay_cga\sand-distribution_model\dnrPackages\stratlines directory.

<div class="content">
I was helping a co-worker who needed to check if a field exists in their arcpy script. Since we were located at their computer, I thought I would just do a quick Google search and pull the code off this blog. Seemed logical since I the original purpose was exactly that—to serve as a handy, public place to store code snippets that I use &amp; that others might find handy.
