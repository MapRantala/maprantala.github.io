<p>Ok, it has been to long since I last posted and I thank those few people who asked If I had suffered a Segmentation Violation or something.</p>
<p>By means of a brief explanation, I changed jobs last summer, going back to a previous employer in a very different role than what I&rsquo;ve ever had before. It was a challenging and difficult and one that I had minimal success at but, in the end, didn&rsquo;t work out. Mostly because I wasn&rsquo;t a good fit for a variety of reasons including, not surprisingly, geography!  I was mostly tele-commuting because the office was two hours away. I really needed to be in the office more than I was and I wasn&rsquo;t in a position to relocate.</p>
<p>During my time with that employer I was doing less technical stuff and just did not feel the urgency to be blogging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve left that job (which was very hard to do because I felt like I was abandoning friends) and have a short-term gig with the employer I left in the summer which will be almost entirely technical work, so I hope to crank out some more technical blog posts.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m hoping to shift my career focus somewhat. I&rsquo;ve been somewhat stuck as a desktop guy–developing mostly desktop applications.  I&rsquo;ve wanted to do more web development stuff but never made the switch. I&rsquo;m hoping to build my web skills in the short-term and have been cramming on topics like Java, HTML5, CSS, Map Server, Geo Server, php, jQuery, and anything else that might enhance my web-abilities.</p>
<p>So expect some changes to the blog and I thank everyone who comes to the blog, while the numbers aren&rsquo;t huge, I am still surprised at how many people find their way here.</p>
